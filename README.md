## Traffic Video Processing
### Abstract

In this page you will find the documents of our project, based in tracking and surveillance of a traffic road. Our solution will accomplish the goal of detecting, tracking and monitoring the velocity of cars in a road in order to prevent any possible accidents or any exceed in the speed limit. 
Some techniques that we have used in this project have been: background substraction, foreground segmentation, object tracking and video stabilization.
